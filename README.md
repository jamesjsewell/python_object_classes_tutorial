# OBJECTS AND CLASSES EXAMPLE #

directions for use:

* keep these files in the same directory
* run the start_program.py file

you'll see that once you run start_house_program.py file
that it prints out the houses in the terminal

this version of the app is only meant to take in "user defined"
house data, create the "houses" from that data, and print it out 
to the console

future versions of the app will allow the user to create, view, edit, and delete houses.
